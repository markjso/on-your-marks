      <h1>About Me</h1>

       <p>My experience includes administration, accounts receivable and payable, bank reconciliation and BAS, change management, social media marketing , word processing, scheduling and general office support.</p> 

        <p>I have an Advanced Diploma in Tourism and am currently the joint owner of a small business specialising in corporate and private events.</p>

        <p>I understand the daily challenges faced by business owners, particularly small business, where it is not always possible to have permanent staff in place to support the daily activities of a business.  
          It can be difficult as an owner to find the time to plan, to review business goals/strategy and most importantly to maintain a positive work/life balance.</p>

        <p>That’s where I can help. I look forward to giving you the gift of time.</p>
